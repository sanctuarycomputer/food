            <h1>Food Technology.</h1>
            <p>At Sanctuary Computer, we’ve spent the last three years honing our skills at working in the specific realm of Food Technology.  Be it integrating with <a href="https://www.thelevelup.com/" target="_blank">LevelUp</a>, navigating various POS requirements, modelling complicated menu pricing rules across many locations, or configuring order throttling to ensure kitchens aren’t overwhelmed during a lunch rush, we’ve done it all.</p>

            <p>Our custom ordering applications are built with Facebook’s <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> (or React Native), Redux, a slew of modern tools and some secret building blocks we’ve developed in-house to provide snappy, intelligent and highly interactive user interfaces, that respect and guide the customer throughout.</p>

            <p>Through our extensive experience, our work has been featured on GQ, Vice, Refinery 29 and many others, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors.</p>

            <p>While our performance metrics are confidential, we can say with pride that our software continues to process millions of dollars for fast casual restaurants across the USA in the last year.</p>

            <p>We’re based in NYC, and we work with companies all across the USA (and we’d love to work internationally!).  If you’re looking for a reliable, friendly and hospitable technology partner, please reach out to our President & Studio Lead, Hugh Francis (<a href="mailto:hugh@sanctuary.computer?subject=Your work makes us hungry!" target="_blank">email</a>).</p>

          <h1>Dig Inn</h1>
          <p>Developed on top of Dig Inn's existing menu, the Dig Inn application integrates deeply with LevelUp to provide a sophisticated Loyalty & Pay-In-Store experience. In order to emulate the in-store interaction, a streamlined item builder was developed to ensure users can build Marketbowls with ease.</p>

          <h1>Rōti</h1>
          <p>With over 40 locations across the US, and such a diverse range of ingredients, the Roti team wanted to optimize their Web experience for menu exploration. By focusing the item build UI for content and flavor profile, we were able to help users understand what they may expect from a topping or sauce they haven't tried before. For the less adventurous, we included a recommendation mode based on that same flavor profile concept.</p>

A complex balance of yeast, bacteria, time, temperature, moisture, and fermentation acts on the simplest of ingredients; flour water and salt, to create one of humankind’s most elemental foods.</p>

          <p>Continuing our collaboration with Tartine, we also rolled out the online ordering functionality for their sub-brand, Coffee Manufactory.
